# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Setup and Running Instructions

To get the code up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies and Start the Development Server**

   Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies and start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm install -- install dependencies
   npm run dev -- run on your local
   ```
